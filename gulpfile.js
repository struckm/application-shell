 * that can be chained together and will mutate the input before it's
 * served to a browser. For example, Javascript and Sass are minified
 * in production environments.
 *
 * This gulpfile calls require('require-dir')('gulp-tasks') which will look
 * in the gulp-tasks folder for any gulp "tasks" it can find and load them
 * so that they can be used in this file.
 *
 * If you find a task (see var allTasks below which is an array of tasks),
 * you should find a file with the same name inside of gulp-tasks/. This
 * file will have the task inside of it.
